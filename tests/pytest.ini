# Comprehensive test markers for selective execution
markers =
    # Test types
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated, <100ms each)
    integration: Integration tests (cross-component, <5s each)
    system: System-level tests (end-to-end, <30s each)
    e2e: End-to-end tests (full system, <60s each)

    # Test characteristics
    critical: Critical system tests (safety, recovery)
    performance: Performance and load tests
    safety: Safety-critical tests (must pass)
    slow: Slow-running tests (>5s, skip in fast mode)
    flaky: Known flaky tests (investigate separately)

    # Environment requirements
    ros2: Tests requiring ROS2 environment
    launch_testing: Tests using launch_testing framework (ROS2 Jazzy best practice)
    hardware: Tests requiring physical hardware
    requires_ros2: Alias for ros2 (skip when ROS2 not available)
    requires_autonomy_interfaces: Requires autonomy_interfaces package (colcon build)
    live_blackboard: Tests requiring running bt_orchestrator and blackboard services
    simulation: Tests requiring Gazebo simulation
    network: Tests requiring network connectivity

    # Component focus
    autonomy: Autonomous operation tests
    perception: Vision and sensor processing tests
    control: Motor control and hardware interface tests
    navigation: Path planning and localization tests
    mission: Mission execution and coordination tests
    state_machine: State machine and behavior tree tests
    communication: Network and inter-system communication tests

    # Special categories
    competition: URC competition specific scenarios
    endurance: Long-duration stability tests
    chaos: Chaos engineering and fault injection tests
    security: Security validation tests
    calibration: Sensor calibration tests

    # Plan traceability (Blackboard BT State Machine plan)
    plan_1_1: Plan 1.1 Blackboard hierarchical dot keys (C++/Python contract)
    plan_1_2: Plan 1.2 Blackboard constants everywhere (no raw strings)
    plan_1_3: Plan 1.3 Blackboard persistence save/load and safety
    plan_2_1: Plan 2.1 State machine hybrid flags (mode_request, human_override, auto_assist)
    plan_2_2: Plan 2.2 State machine safety checks before mode switch
    plan_3: Plan 3 BT emergency-first and mode-based execution
    plan_5_1: Plan 5.1 Unit tests for blackboard/state machine/hybrid
