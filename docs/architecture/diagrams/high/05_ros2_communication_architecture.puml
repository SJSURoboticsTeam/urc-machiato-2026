note right of topics
  Communication Patterns:
  - Topics: Asynchronous data streams (10-100Hz)
  - Services: Synchronous requests (< 1Hz)
  - Actions: Long-running tasks with feedback
  - QoS: BEST_EFFORT for sensors, RELIABLE for commands

  Key Interfaces:
  - Topics: Sensor data & status updates
  - Services: Configuration & control
  - Actions: Mission execution with progress
